# Hello blog!
This blog uses Jekyll, a simple static site generator

## Dependencies
In order to work with this blog architecture, you need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/de/ "Ruby") installed. [This](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/ "Ruby on Windows") site shows how to install Ruby on Windows. On MacOS and Linux it's even easier.

To have your blog running on localhost, navigate to your blog folder and run:
```
jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""
```
